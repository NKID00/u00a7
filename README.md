Brings back the good old formatting codes.

## Usage

Simply type or copypaste your favorite formatting codes and it just works.

Additionally, you can use Ctrl+& or Ctrl+7 to type formatting symbols (i.e. section signs, ยง) easily and swiftly. 

\[WIP\] All features are toggleable in the configuration screen, which can be entered through [mod menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).

## Installation

Minecraft 1.19 and the latest Fabric Loader is required.

The mod only needs to be installed on client-side.

However, the server must accept packets that contains formatting codes otherwise the player will be kicked. You may either install mods or plugins that unlocks formatting codes (e.g. u00a7 :P) on the server-side or use servers that ship with no builtin formatting codes bans (e.g. any vanilla server before 1.14).

## Build
