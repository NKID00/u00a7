Brings back the good old formatting codes.

## Usage

Simply type or copypaste your favorite formatting codes and it just works.

\[WIP\] Additionally, you may use Ctrl+& or Ctrl+7 to type section signs (ยง) more easily and swiftly. 

## Installation

Minecraft 1.19 and the latest Fabric Loader is required.

The mod only needs to be installed on client-side.

However, the server must accept packets that contains formatting codes otherwise the player will be kicked. You may either install mods or plugins that unlocks formatting codes (for example, u00a7 :P) on the server-side or use servers that ship with no builtin formatting codes bans.

## Build

```sh
./gradlew build
```

Built jar is located in `build/libs/`.
